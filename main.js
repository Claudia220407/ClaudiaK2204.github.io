  "For the deep talks and the dumb jokes,",

  "I want to do it all with youâ€”lazy Sundays, wild adventures, building dreams, growing older.",
  "I canâ€™t wait to fill more pages of life with you. ðŸ’•",
  "More laughs, more kisses, more late-night talks and early-morning cuddles.",
  "More inside jokes, more memories, more versions of 'us' through every chapter of life.",
  "Youâ€™re my always. My sunshine on the grey days. My safe place. My silly soulmate.",
